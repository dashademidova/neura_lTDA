Application of statistical TDA methods to neural data

The group of K. Anohin held a range of experiments with mice and a circle labyrinth. A mouse was put in the circle track and allowed to walk freely. At the same time neural activity of place cells were recorded. The mouse run back and forth, but its trajectory lied on a circle. If we look at the plots of neural activity, we can see spikes, they mean that a neuron was active at that moment of time. 

Analysis of neural signal consists of such steps:

1. Checking that selected cells are really place cells, i.e. each cell encodes particular place.
2. Representing recorded signals in a space that would be suitable for further topological analysis.
3. Constructing persistence diagrams for different functional representations of the dataset.
4. Statistical analysis of persistence diagrams and reconstruction of topological encoding of the space.
